 # How to Use This Software
 This tool is composed of two main parts:  

Python DLL Injector  

C++ DLL Hook Library  

‚úÖ 1. Setup Requirements  
For Python Scripts  
Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed and install dependencies:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  

# üß© 2. Build the DLL (C++ Project)  
Requirements:  
Visual Studio 2019 or newer  

Visual Studio 2019 or newer  
Platform: Windows x64  or Windows x32

# Project Type: DLL (Dynamic Link Library)

Steps:
Create a new DLL Project in Visual Studio.  

Replace the auto-generated files with:  

`dllmain.cpp`  

`pch.cpp`  

`pch.h`  

`framework.h`  

Set `pch.cpp` and `pch.h` as precompiled headers in project settings.  

Enable /MT or /MD runtime as needed.  

Build the project in Release mode.  

You will get DLLHooks.dll or similar in Release/ folder.  

# üíâ 3. Injecting the DLL Using Python  
Make sure the DLL file is built and available in either of these paths:  

`./DLLHooks.dll`  

`./DLLHooks/Release/DLLHooks.dll`  

# Steps:
Launch the target application (e.g., LockDownBrowser.exe).  

Run the injector:  
`python inject.py`  

The script:  

Waits for **LockDown Browser** to open  

Injects the compiled DLL  

Closes after success  

# üß™ 5. Testing the Functionality
Run LockDown Browser or any target app.  

Inject the DLL via inject.py.  

Press ‚Üë key ‚Äî hooks activate.  

Press ‚Üì key ‚Äî hooks uninstall and reset window state.  

**‚ùó Important Notes**

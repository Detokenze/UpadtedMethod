 # How to Use This Software
 This tool is composed of two main parts:  

Python DLL Injector  

C++ DLL Hook Library  

✅ 1. Setup Requirements  
For Python Scripts  
Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed and install dependencies:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  

# 🧩 2. Build the DLL (C++ Project)  
Requirements:  
Visual Studio 2020 or newer  

Visual Studio 2019 or newer  
Platform: Windows x64  or Windows x32

# Project Type: DLL (Dynamic Link Library)

Steps:
Create a new DLL Project in Visual Studio.  

Replace the auto-generated files with:  

`dllmain.cpp`  

`pch.cpp`  

`pch.h`  

`framework.h`  

Set `pch.cpp` and `pch.h` as precompiled headers in project settings.  

Enable /MT or /MD runtime as needed.  

Build the project in Release mode.  

You will get DLLHooks.dll or similar in Release/ folder.  

# 💉 3. Injecting the DLL Using Python  
Make sure the DLL file is built and available in either of these paths:  

`./DLLHooks.dll`  

`./DLLHooks/Release/DLLHooks.dll`  

# Steps:
Launch the target application (e.g., LockDownBrowser.exe).  

Run the injector:  
```
python inject.py  
```

The script:  

Waits for **LockDown Browser** to open  

Injects the compiled DLL  

Closes after success  

# 🧪 5. Testing the Functionality
Run LockDown Browser or any target app.  

Inject the DLL via inject.py.  

Press ↑ key — hooks activate.  

Press ↓ key — hooks uninstall and reset window state.  

**❗ Important Notes**
Admin rights may be required for full injection.
